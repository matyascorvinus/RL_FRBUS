PyFRB/US is a Python-based simulation platform for the FRB/US model.
The PyFRB/US package depends on SuiteSparse version <= 5.13.0 and `swig` to build UMFPACK at install.
Before installing PyFRB/US, you must install SuiteSparse (`libsuitesparse-dev` on Linux,
or `suite-sparse` on MacOS) and `swig` using your package manager (probably `apt` on
Linux, or Homebrew on MacOS).
On Windows, you can install these dependencies and run PyFRB/US via the Windows Subsystem
for Linux (WSL). See the PyFRB/US User Guide for details.

Installation guideline 
Python version for PyFRB/US: Python 3.7.16
Python version for Streamlit: Python 3.10.12

The PyFRB/US package requires Python 3 and can be installed by running `pip install -e .`
or `pip3 install -e .` from the root directory of this package.
Python dependencies are listed in setup.py and should be automatically installed.

The Streamlit are using different Python version, hence it is advisable to install seperatedly with by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` inside the directory frbus_streamlit_frontend

To access the PyFRB/US documentation, open docs/index.html in a web browser.

To run the original FRB/US, please go to the demos folder, as Demo programs can be found under the demos/ folder.
Demos expect the data/ folder to contain the LONGBASE.TXT dataset, which can be copied
over from the data_only_package.

To run the PPO RL, go to the supreme-ai directory and run the simulation.py

To showcase the result to the Streamlit frontend, run a seperated terminal and type `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000` in parallel with the 'python simulation.py', 
then go to the directory frbus_streamlit_frontend and run streamlit run streamlit-app.py

CHANGELOG
==================

1.1
------------------
 * Bug fixes, performance improvements, updated documentation
 * Added capability for Jacobian re-use
 * Trim stochsim output to sim end period by default to save memory
 * Fix mislabeled chart: output from sim_plot was erroneously labeled "Quarterly Annualized" instead of "4-Quarter Percent Change"

1.0
------------------
 * Initial release.
