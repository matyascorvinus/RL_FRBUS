of real domestic absorption with an elasticity of one, the relative
price of non-oil imports with an elasticity of minus one, and an
exogenous trend.  Historical values of the trend (UEMOT) are measured
by applying the HP filter to the ratio of nominal imports to nominal
absorption.  In the short-run, imports respond strongly to the first
difference of the output gap.  The effect of large dock strikes in the

pass-through of changes in the exchange rate (FPX) or foreign prices
(FPC) into dollar-denominated import prices is incomplete.  In
accordance with this evidence, only 64 percent of any
movement in FPC or FPX is allowed to pass through to PMO in the long
run.  This pass-through relationship is defined in relative terms using
the price of US business output, which accounts for the presence of
PXB in the equilibrium formula. The PMO equation also contains the
contemporaneous rates of foreign and domestic price inflation with the
two coefficients restricted to sum to one.","(log(pmo) - log(pmo(-1)))  - pmo_aerr =
