In\naccordance with this evidence, only 64 percent of any\nmovement in FPC or FPX is allowed to pass through to PMO in the long\nrun.  This pass-through relationship is defined in relative terms using\nthe price of US business output, which accounts for the presence of\nPXB in the equilibrium formula.
